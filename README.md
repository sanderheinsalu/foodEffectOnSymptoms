# foodEffectOnSymptoms
R Shiny application for measuring the effect of foods on gastrointestinal symptoms. Public on shinyapps.io (https://sanderheinsalu.shinyapps.io/foodEffectOnSymptoms/, Estonian version https://sanderheinsalu.shinyapps.io/peeruhaisukatse/). User just uploads a CSV to analyse. 

The first columns in the user-uploaded CSV file are the outputs, the next four columns the time of day dummy variables, the last columns the inputs. This application evaluates the effect of the inputs on the outputs and displays the VARX regression results in a table. Currently only 4 time of day intervals are supported. For example, 06:00-12:00, 12:01-16:00, 16:01-20:00, 20:01-06:00. If a time interval column has 1 in it, this means the row's inputs and outputs occurred in this time interval. In each row, exactly one of the time columns should be 1, the others 0. See an example of the CSV on https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14rU8q4YUpjsmfS1D6n0TdVGvX0-RzCzVyfZGOOnwo_c Each row of the example has outputs (symptoms) and inputs (foods eaten). The inputs and outputs must be numeric. For example, 1 means the input was consumed, 0 that it was not. Or 0,1,2,... units of input consumed. The header row may consist of any text without spaces. The file should have at least twice more rows (observations) than the total number of input and output columns.
